3d showcase using google's model-viewer
Thank you for visiting my website! WEBSITE : https://camilolucero.me/3D-showcase/index.html
This is my first Project working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This was done with the library model-viewer made by Google.
"Ole Gunnar Isager" was the user who posted the animations and 3D Model on the website Sketchfab, which I downloaded. These animations/models were NOT created by me; all credit is due to the original Creator.
This is the first gun I will display; I intend to add others. If you have comments about this website, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me at camilo@camilolucero.me
